 * The mmapGpio Class is able to control the direction and state of all GPIO pins
 * on the RPI's 26-pin header using the 'mmaping into /dev/mem' approach. The advantage of this approach is 
 * that GPIO toggling speeds of uptp 21MHz can be achieved whereas the toggling gpio
 * speed using the sysfs interface is in the 100s of KHz.
 *
 * This class is not comprehensive as it does not enable PAD manipulation, Pull-up control
 * or interrupts,but it is adequate for basic GPIO use
